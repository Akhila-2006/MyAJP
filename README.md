# ‚òï Java Collections Framework ‚Äì MyAJP Repository

This repository contains basic implementations and demonstrations of various **Java Collection Framework** classes, as part of my **Advanced Java Programming (AJP)** practice.

Each `.java` file in this repo demonstrates how to create, use, and manipulate collection objects like **ArrayList**, **HashSet**, **TreeSet**, **LinkedList**, and **PriorityQueue**.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### ‚úÖ List Implementations
- `ArrayList.java` ‚Äì Demonstrates operations like adding, removing, accessing elements, and iteration over an `ArrayList`.
- `LinkedList.java` ‚Äì Shows usage of `LinkedList` as a list and queue with methods like `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, etc.

### ‚úÖ Set Implementations
- `HashSet.java` ‚Äì Example using `HashSet` to store unique elements and perform operations like `add`, `remove`, and `contains`.
- `TreeSet.java` ‚Äì Demonstrates a sorted set using `TreeSet` and shows automatic sorting of elements.

### ‚úÖ Queue Implementation
- `PrirorityQueue.java` ‚Äì Example showing how elements are ordered naturally or via custom comparator in a `PriorityQueue`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: There seems to be a typo in the filename `PrirorityQueue.java`. It should ideally be named `PriorityQueue.java`.
